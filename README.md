We investigated the state-of-the-art data poisoning attack based on [style transfer](https://github.com/thunlp/StyleAttack). Our aim is to identify and document the critical limitations that might prevent this (and other similar) attacking strategy from being practical. Through comprehensive empirical analysis and detailed case studies, which are not contained in the original paper, we support our conclusions and provide insights into the effectiveness and detectability of such attacks.
